# /api/upload-form

> should be as close as possible to [/api/upload-attachment](./upload-attachment)

An alternative endpoint provided, to allow different behaviour in future

Probably we this endpoint doesn't expect the random `id` but an `form` variable, describing which of the subforms (steps) was submitted
